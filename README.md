# Personal-Website
This is my website I built using strictly HTML and CSS. This serves as my entry into full stack development.

This website is by no means the cleanest, sleekest, or best looking. That wasn't my main focus. The inspiration for this came from a video by youtuber Steph Ran. In this video, she made her own website in a couple days. Not only did her video inspire me to create my own website, I loved some of the design choices and implemented them into my own website.

So I haven't created a domain for this. So, you'll have to download each file and run it locally to see what it looks like.

For the design, I wanted to format the website similarly to what my resume looks like, except with some minor changes. There is an "About Me" section, which includes a greeting, a picture of me, and a short introduction. The next section is the "Work Experience" section, which showcases all of the formal work experience I have. After that, there is the "Projects" section, which includes all of the personal projects I've worked on/completed. The second to last section is the "Skills" section, where I used Font Awesome icons to represent some of the languages and applications I'm proficient in/have experience with. The last section is the "Leave a Message" section, where any user can (hopefully) send me a message. For this section, I built my own form handling script. Hopefully, it works.
