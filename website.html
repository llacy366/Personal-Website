        <p class="bio"> 
            I'm Luke, a current Regent University student and computer science major.
            I'm extremely passionate about programming and software engineering, 
            specifically frontend development. I am equipped with a love of learning and an eagerness to experiment that sets me apart from the rest!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="bio-2"> 
            Outside of academics and coding, I enjoy playing basketball, listening to music,
            spending time with my friends, and going to the gym. One thing I really love, specifically about music, is sharing certain songs I like
            with my friends and seeing their first reactions. It always brings me joy when they love the songs and add them to their playlists.

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p class="work">
            The only formal work experience I have is working at Ross 
            during Summer 2024 and Winter Break 2024-2025. During my time there, there were a list of tasks I accomplished:
            <ul>
                <br>
                <li>I delivered exceptional customer service by helping shoppers find the products they were looking for, answering questions/clearing up confusion, and resolving issues on my own quickly and effectively.</li>
                <li>I handled high-pressure retail environments during busy seasons, maintaining a positive attitude and making sure checkout lines moved quickly and efficienly.</li>
                <li>I operated point-of-sale systems accurately, managing transactions with pinpoint precision.</li>
                <li>I helped keep the store well-organized by restocking shelves, maintaining displays, and upholding the standard for cleanliness and presentation.</li>
                <li>I collaborated with team members to meet daily sales targets, showing strong communication and teamwork skills.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="work-2">
            I do have ample experience using high-level languages such as Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS from classes I've taken and personal projects I've worked on.
            I've taken classes such as Data Structures and Algorithms, Programming in C++, Linear Algebra,
            Mobile and Smart Computing, Parallel and Distributive Programming,
            Computer Architecture, Software Engineering, and more. From these classes, I've learned important
            coding practices that I've implemented in my personal projects, giving me a well-rounded
            and versatile tool kit. You can find the projects I've completed and skills I have in the sections below!

                <p>For this project, I created a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game within the terminal. The project is considered unfinished because there are a few bugs with the code. However, it is necessary to add this project as it is a project I'm working on.</p>
